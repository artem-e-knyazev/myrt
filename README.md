# Myrt

*Myrt* stands for "My RayTracer". It's a simple path tracing app, written to experiment with C++ in the "real app" context. It uses `myrt-math` package that abstracts some 3D math types and operations.

## Inspirations

It is inspired mostly by Peter Shirley's book series on raytracing ([one](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8), [two](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Next-Week-Minibooks-ebook/dp/B01CO7PQ8C/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) and [three](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Rest-Your-Minibooks-ebook/dp/B01DN58P8C/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8). Some of the code is just copy-pasted, but I plan to rewrite it sometime.
